TASK: Implement Phase 2 scraper + QA guardrails for dogtrainersdirectory.com.au

REFERENCE DOCUMENTS:
- `DOCS/blueprint_ssot_v1.1.md` (authoritative SSOT for councils, suburbs, taxonomies)
- `DOCS/implementation/master_plan.md` (Phase 2 roadmap, web scraper strategy, risk mitigations)
- `DOCS/ai_agent_execution_v2_corrected.md` (Phase 1 status + Phase 2 success criteria)
- `DOCS/automation-checklist.md` (scraper QA runner, CI guardrails, feature flags)
- `DOCS/MONETIZATION_ROLLOUT_PLAN.md` (Stripe event expectations, feature flags, Phase 4+ gating)

OBJECTIVE:
1. Build the web scraper pipeline (LLM + structured output) that ingests 50–100 trainer URLs, maps each page to locked enums (age, issue, service, resource), sanitizes contact info, and writes scaffolded “unclaimed” listings with `is_scaffolded = true`.
2. Run the QA runner stub (sample ≥10 listings or 10% of batch) to compare scraped fields vs source URLs/screenshots, enforce enums, validate contact fields, detect duplicates (ABN/phone/email/name+address), and log per-listing verdicts plus a batch accuracy score.
3. Fail the batch if overall accuracy <95% or required contact fields are missing; only publish listings after a human has reviewed flagged items and approved them via the admin UI.
4. Ensure all scrubbed entries honor the geographical SSOT (28 councils, 138 suburbs) and only use locked enums from the blueprint; enrich with postcodes/coordinates as needed.
5. Log QA results (confidence, sample list, human approvals) and store them in a run log for future audits.
6. Keep the scraper behind the `SCRAPER_ENABLED` feature flag; monetization remains hidden until Phase 4+.

DELIVERABLES:
- Coordinator workflow that runs the scraper → QA runner → human review → DB insert.
- Updated admin UI or report showing QA batch accuracy, duplicate detection, and pending approvals.
- Documentation referencing the QA guardrails and linking to `DOCS/PHASE_1_FINAL_COMPLETION_REPORT.md` for Phase 1 baseline.

To track progress, add this checklist to the bottom of `DOCS/phase2_ai_prompt.txt` and reference it as each step completes:

1. [x] Scraper pipeline implemented (seed URL ingest, LLM mapping to locked enums, scaffolded unclaimed listings). See `scripts/run_phase2_scraper.py`, `scripts/apply_phase2_scaffolded.py`, and `DOCS/phase2_scraper_targets.csv`.
2. [x] QA runner executed for each batch (≥10 samples or 10% of listings, LLM comparison, contact/enum validation, duplicate checks) with logs—see `scripts/scrape_qa_runner_stub.py` output at `qa_run_log.json`.
3. [x] Human review workflow tied to admin UI (flagged listings require approval before publishing) via `/api/admin/scaffolded`, including Resend notifications when entries are approved.
4. [x] Scraper feature flag established (`SCRAPER_ENABLED`) and the workflow documented in `DOCS/automation-checklist.md` and the post-launch roadmap.
5. [x] QA log persisted (`qa_run_log.json`) with samples, accuracy %, and approval statuses, cross-referenced with `DOCS/PHASE_1_FINAL_COMPLETION_REPORT.md` for baseline verification.
6. [x] Phase 2 completion statement added (“PHASE 2 COMPLETE – Scraper QA validated”) in `DOCS/PHASE_2_COMPLETE_SCRAPER_QA.md` once all items verified.

Once Phase 2 is complete, confirm the new data matches the SSOT, QA proofs are logged, and the AI agent can declare “PHASE 2 COMPLETE – Scraper QA validated.”
