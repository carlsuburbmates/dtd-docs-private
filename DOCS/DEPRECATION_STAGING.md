# Deprecation Staging

This ledger tracks components that appear unused, placeholder-only, or superseded. Entries remain here until they are either remediated or intentionally removed following governance sign-off.

| Identifier | Why Suspect | Linked Docs | Proposed Action | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `src/app/trainer/[slug]/page.tsx` & `TrainerProfileClient.tsx` | Duplicate profile experience that re-fetches via slug/ID shim and depends on `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`. `DOCS/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_UPDATED.md` already calls for resolving `/trainer/[slug]` vs `/trainers/[id]`. 2025-12-09: SearchAutocomplete, directory browse, and search results now link directly to `/trainers/<id>`; slug components deleted. | DOCS/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_UPDATED.md; DOCS/FRONTEND_VERIFICATION_FINDINGS.md | Completed – canonical profile route is `/trainers/[id]`; slug variant removed with no remaining references. | SAFE-TO-REMOVE (removed 2025-12-09) |
| `src/app/trainer/page.tsx` (Trainer dashboard using `DUMMY_BUSINESS_ID`) | Dashboard fetches `/api/trainer/dashboard` with hard-coded `DUMMY_BUSINESS_ID` and no auth; PRODUCTION doc claims trainer dashboard is complete. No UI links point to `/trainer` and trainer auth work is deferred, so placeholder dashboard was removed. | README.md; DOCS/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_UPDATED.md | Remove dummy dashboard until authenticated trainer tooling ships; any future dashboard must live under a protected route. | SAFE-TO-REMOVE (removed 2025-12-09) |
| `src/app/api/test/errors/route.ts` | Intended only for manual error logging tests; fails type-check because `NextRequest` type is missing. Not referenced by canonical docs outside Week 3 QA instructions. Admin dashboard CTA pointing to the route was removed, so manual QA now uses `/api/admin/errors/trigger-alert` instead. | DOCS/WEEK_3_COMPLETION_REPORT.md | Retire legacy QA endpoint and rely on automated logging plus alert trigger harness. | SAFE-TO-REMOVE (removed 2025-12-09) |
| `src/components/search/FiltersSidebar.tsx` | Component was part of an older faceted search flow; no imports or route/test references remain after the directory/search rewrite. Only mentioned in `_legacy_conflicts/FRONTEND_IMPLEMENTATION_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`. | DOCS/_legacy_conflicts/FRONTEND_IMPLEMENTATION_GAP_ANALYSIS.md | Confirm whether future search iterations still need this UI. Remove once modern filter UX is locked. | SAFE-TO-REMOVE (removed 2025-12-09) |
| `scripts/lint-noop.js` | Legacy placeholder from the L0 lint phase; no package.json scripts or CI workflows invoke it now that linting is active. Only referenced in historical change logs. | DOCS/LINTING_RESTORE_PLAN.md (history); DOCS/CHANGE_CONTROL_LOG.md | Delete once verified that no external automation depends on the file. | SAFE-TO-REMOVE (removed 2025-12-09) |
