# Agent Style Rules — Visual & Tone Constraints

- Tone: calm, precise, clinical; avoid playful or flashy adjectives.
- Visuals: no neon, no heavy gradients, no animated color flashes.
- Typography: use neutral, readable fonts; strong hierarchy but minimal weight variations.
- Colors: use tokenized CSS variables only; do not hardcode Tailwind color utilities.
- Accessibility: WCAG AA contrast for body text and buttons.
- Council Logic: always derive council from suburb; never show LGA selection.
